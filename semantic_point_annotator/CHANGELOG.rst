0.2.0 (2022-05-18)
------------------
* fix build in noetic (`#44 <https://github.com/pr2/pr2_navigation/issues/44>`_)
  I'm not claiming that any of these packages work as they should on
  noetic. Claiming they worked on kinetic might be a stretch.

  * removed eigen dependency from semantic_point_aggregator
  * added c++11 compile option to pr2_navigation_self_filter

* Porting the ground removal stuff away from PointCloud to PointCloud2. Still needs testing though.
* Remove deprecated API usage
* eigen updates
* port to eigen3 and remove deprecated use of message size
* Unreal, the code actually depended on reading the parameters every cycle to work because it reset the value of z_threshold_ which got transformed to a different frame every cycle
* Removing reading of parameters from the cloud callback
* Changing in all three files instead of just one for empty cloud... this package is a mess... really should switch to new pcl stufff
* Empty clouds are sometimes expected and should be passed on... not errored on and dropped
* Copying pr2_navigation from staging area to stacks section of the repoistory
